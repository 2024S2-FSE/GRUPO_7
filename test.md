##Review:

Difficulties of Client Requirements and Management: 

• Clients often don’t know what is needed or what is feasible.

  Os clientes não sabem o que é preciso, e também o que é "doable"(fazível)

• Clients often lack appreciation for the complexities inherent in software engineering, particularly regarding the impact of changing requirements.

  Os clientes devido a não saberem da complexidade inerente na engenharia do software, não tem a devida consciência do impacto da mudança de requerimentos

• As a result of changing requirements, software is often built using an iterative process rather than as a sequence of closed tasks.
• Software engineering necessarily incorporates creativity and discipline. Maintaining an appropriate balance between the two is sometimes difficult.
• The degree of novelty and complexity is often high.
• There is often a rapid rate of change in the underlying technology.
